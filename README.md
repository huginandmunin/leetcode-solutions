## Leet Code

Python solutions to Leet Code problems. 
These are solutions that I developed independently.

They can be validated by running `pytest` on the tests in the `python/test` directory. 

The repo uses a github action to run pytest when commits are pushed to the repo.
The configuration file is

[`.github/workflows/run_tests.yaml`](https://github.com/huginandmunin/leetcode-solutions/blob/main/.github/workflows/run_tests.yaml)

This runs the tests with python3.9 on ubuntu.
